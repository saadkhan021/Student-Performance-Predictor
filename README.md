# Classification Model (Supervised Learning) 
Project Title: Student Performance Predictor 
Goal: Predict if a student will pass or fail based on their features. 
Dataset Suggestion: Student Performance Dataset 
Tasks: 
• Select target (e.g., Pass/Fail using threshold on scores) 
• Train simple models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree 
• Evaluate using accuracy, precision, confusion matrix 
• Explain how certain features affect performance 
Learning Focus: 
    ✔ Supervised learning 
    ✔ Binary classification 
    ✔ Model evaluation and comparison
